# Process

Agreed on our way of working

- Agreed on a single method of communication about this project (slack)
- Agreed on what branches we will work in and will only merge in main after communicating to the rest of the team via slack
- Agreed where our single point of truth for this application will be stored (Figma)
- Agreed a rough plan of how we intend the week to go

Understanding the problem

- Tried to understand the core need for the application and wrote this in a single sentence

Defining and refining

- Defined the core requirements of the application and added each requirement as tickets in a kanban board
- Went through each ticket as a team to ensure we are all aligned with the requirments and how we indend to tackle the ticket

Design planning

- Found a few examples of similar journalling websites and took full screenshots of them
- Using Figma, as a team we went through each of these example screenshots and discussed what we liked and disliked about thier design
- Then as a team we drew a LoFi wireframe of our application

Organising and planning

- Assigned a few tickets to each team memeber
- Planned regular catch up sessions each day (morning, afternoon, evening) to see how everyone is doing and if we need to re-align/re-distribute work
